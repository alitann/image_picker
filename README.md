# Flutter Image Picker and Collage

This flutter application takes images from your phone's storage(gallery) or camera and provides you to generate a pdf file that contains collage of selected images.

We are going to use flutter_bloc package for state management for every state changing. We definitely are not using setState. 

Also we are going to use repository pattern for testable and easily maintaible code.
